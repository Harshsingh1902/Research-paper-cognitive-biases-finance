## Abstract
Abstract 
Consumer spending behaviour holds critical position in behavioural finance, as decision patterns shape financial outcomes for individuals and the broader economy. Spending decisions are influenced by cognitive biases, heuristics and macroeconomic conditions. The primary goal of this analysis is to find out the role of heuristic techniques and cognitive biases in spending decision-making and to suggest directions for future studies. In this research we have adopted a literature review method to analyse the primary behavioural finance biases and their influence on spending decisions. The paper presents an overview of how heuristic approaches and cognitive biases shape spending behaviour among consumers. Findings from concept analysis indicate that, in recent times, consumers increasingly aim to minimize spending and maximize savings, often relying on heuristics that can result in consistent mistakes in decision-making. From a practical perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of improving financial 
literacy, which is important for making sound spending decisions in today's market and also for reducing extra dependency on potentially misleading heuristics. This study addresses the combined effects of heuristic techniques and cognitive biases on spending decisions, offering recommendations for future research. It contributes to growing body of literature that applies behavioural finance perspective to consumer financial behaviour. 

Keywords: Heuristic Techniques, Cognitive Biases, Spending Decision-Making, Traditional 
Finance, Behavioural Finance.
